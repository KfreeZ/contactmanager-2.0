First install the right npm packages by executing <code>npm install</code> and then <code>bower install</code>.

(Bower could offer you a choice when installing angular 1.2.0 (rc1):
<pre>
Unable to find a suitable version for angular, please choose one:
    1) angular#1.2.0rc1 which resolved to 1.2.0rc1 and has Contact Manager, angular-route#9d2458ecdb as dependants
    2) angular#>=1 which resolved to 1.0.7 and has angular-bootstrap#0.4.0 as dependants
</pre>

Please pick option 1.

You can start the app by: <code>npm start</code> - runs on port 1222. (This is different, before the app started by <code>node app.js</code>, although this method will still work)
